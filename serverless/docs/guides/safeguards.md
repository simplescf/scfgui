# Safeguards

**Safeguards** is a policy-as-code framework for Serverless Framework which enables you to inspect your serverless.yml file, and the generated Cloud Formation templates, for compliance with security, operational, and organizational, best practices.

Safeguards was a feature of the Serverless Framework Pro dashboard and available under the legacy team tier. On August 1st, 2020, it was open sourced and made available free-of-charge as a stand-alone Serverless Framework Plugin free of charge.

You can find the new plugin at [serverless/safeguards-plugin](https://github.com/serverless/safeguards-plugin/).

You can easily migrate your safeguard policies from the SF Pro dashboard to the `@serverless/safegurds-plugin` by following the [Migration from Serverless Framework Pro guide](https://github.com/serverless/safeguards-plugin/#migrating-from-serverless-framework-pro).
